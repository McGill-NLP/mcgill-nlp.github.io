The McGill NLP reading group hosts speaker presentations and NLP-related discussions in a hybrid fashion at Mila. It is called the McGill NLP reading group for historical reasons, but actively gathers NLP researchers from different Mila-affiliated research institutes across Montreal (McGill University, University of Montreal, etc.). 

## Admin

The current organizers are [Andrei Mircea](https://mirandrom.github.io/), [Cesare Spinoso](https://cesare-spinoso.github.io/), [Senyu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9MzYLOcAAAAJ&hl=en), [Tom√°s Vergara Browne](https://tvergara.github.io/) and [Ziling Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_2W8Ai4AAAAJ&hl=en)[^1]. They will be taking **monthly turns** organizing the reading group and its related activities.

For more information about the reading group or for requests to join the mailing list, send an e-mail to the organizers at `compling-owner at cs dot mcgill dot ca`. For spam filtering reasons, you will need to reply to a confirmation e-mail. Note that this mailing list is used for people outside of Mila. If you already have a Mila email, you will automatically receive reading group announcements through the `mila-event-announcement` mailing list.

## History

The McGill NLP reading group was originally started by [Prof. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/) in the summer of 2015 at McGill and was originally called the Computational Linguistics (CompLing) reading group. In 2019, the CompLing reading group (McGill-specific) merged with the Language Understanding reading group (Mila-wide) to become what it is today. Previous reading group organizers have been: Jackie Cheung (2015), Jad Kabbara (2016), Ali Emami (2017), Yue Dong (2018), Kushal Arora (2019), Aishik Chakraborty (2020), Ian Porada (2021), Arian Hosseini (2019 to 2023), Vaibhav Adlakha (2022 to 2024) and Ori Ernst (2024 to 2025).
