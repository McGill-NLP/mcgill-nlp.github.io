# McGill NLP Website

### [➡️ Click Here to Add Your Profile or Paper ⬅️](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mcgill-nlp.github.io/issues/new/choose)

<br>

This is the source code of the [group website](https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/), which was built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

## Quickstart

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should probably read this section!

For certain contributions, it is possible to fill GitHub forms and everything will be automated without requiring to fork or modify the codebase. This currently works for:
* Adding or updating the profile of a lab member
* Adding a paper written by a lab member
  * With manual information entry
  * With a URL (for limited number of websites)
* Adding all papers by a certain author within a time frame

To get started, [click here to open the issue forms](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mcgill-nlp.github.io/issues/new/choose).

> [!NOTE]
> * *If you made a mistake but already submitted the form, please see how to correct it in [FAQ](#FAQ).*
> * *If you are looking to build a project website/webpage for your paper, check out the [project page template](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/project-page-template), which has the same style as this website.*

## Steps to contribute

For other types of contribution (not covered by the issue form), please follow these steps:
1. [Fork](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mcgill-nlp.github.io/fork) the repository.
2. Add your contribution by editing the desired files.
3. Create a pull request: Click on the [Pull Request](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mcgill-nlp.github.io/pulls) tab and select "New pull request". Select the repository you forked and modified.
4. Wait for a team member to review and merge your pull request.

## Add new member profile

> [!NOTE]
> *Have you tried using issue forms? They should be faster and easier for most of the (simpler) scenarios. This section is only if you need to make custom changes not covered by the forms.*

Navigate to [_data/authors.yml](./_data/authors.yml) and add the desired information at the end of the file. It has to follow the following template:

```yaml
John Doe:  # Your full name; this will be used for post `author`
  name: "John Doe"
  role: "PhD"   # One of: "Faculty", "Adjunct Faculty", "Postdoc", "PhD", "Master", "Undergraduate", "Intern"
  avatar: "/assets/images/bio/placeholder/default.jpg"  # Path to image of you (place in assets/images/bio)
  advisor: "John Doe Sr." # The advisor or advisors of the new member
  date: "Sep 2030"  # Start date. Must be in the "MMM YYYY" format, or "Fall"/"Winter".
  bio: "Just some cool student" # Describe the new member (optional)
  note: "Co-advised by Amasa L." # Additional notes (optional)
  alumni: false # Whether the new member is an alumni
  new_role: "Professing at Leland Junior S. University" # If an alumni, their new role
  auto_update_publications: false. # Whether to automatically look for new papers published by this author every 2 weeks
  links:
    - label: "Website"
      url: "https://john-doe.github.io/" # Link to website
    - label: "GitHub"
      url: "https://github.com/john-doe" # Link to Github profile
    - label: "Twitter"
      url: "https://twitter.com/john-doe" # Link to Twitter profile
    - label: "Scholar"
      icon: "fas fa-fw fa-graduation-cap" # Font Awesome icon
      url: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=<user_id>" # Link to Google Scholar profile
```

This will look like this:

![Demo of user profile](.github/images/demo-profile.jpg)

`John Doe`: Replace `John Doe` with your full name. This will be what you will use when writing a blog post or a publication abstract, and is required for certain automatic forms. Note that if someone already has the same name, you can append your start date, but that might break some automations.

`avatar`: Note that the `avatar` field links to an image located in `assets/images/bio`. You will need to upload the image to the repository before it shows up. Make sure you choose a picture in `jpg` (to save space), an aspect ratio of 1:1, resolution of about 300x300, and mainly centered around the face. In a hurry, you may use the default image.

`icon`: An icon that can be found in the [Font Awesome v5 free library](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search?m=free). V6 (most recent) will not work. In the HTML snippet, copy the string after `class=`. For example, if your string is `<i class="fab fa-accessible-icon"></i>`, then only copy `"fas fa-graduation-cap"` for the Google Scholar icon. This is optional only when `label` is "Website", "GitHub", "LinkedIn", or "Twitter". Otherwise, that link will not appear under your name in `/people/`.

### Modifying a member's profile

Has a member graduated? Does a member wish to have a new profile picture or bio? You can modify the profile of a member by editing the `_data/authors.yml` file.

### Deleting a member

If you wish to delete a member (e.g. added by mistake, duplicates, etc.) you can directly delete their "block" (everything indented after their name) in the `_data/authors.yml` file.


## Front matters and YAML

For any type of page or post (publication, blog post, course description), we use something called ["Front Matters"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to tell Jekyll about the purpose of the file. This is a block of YAML text at the beginning of the file. The rest of the file is regular [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Modify pages

> [!WARNING]
> *This section is for advanced users. You will likely not need it unless you are intend to maintain this website or fix specific issues with page rendering*

To modify a page, navigate to [_pages](_pages/) and update the desired file. If you add a new file, you will also need to edit the [_data/navigation.yml](_data/navigation.yml) file with the correct relative URL.

The following pages are mostly likely to be frequently updated:
* [home](_pages/home.md)
* [contact](_pages/contact.md)

The following pages are not likely to be frequently updated:
* [people](_pages/people.md) 
* [publications](_pages/publications.md)
* [blog](_pages/blog.md)
* [teaching](_pages/teaching.md)

Note: If you want to add new content to one of the pages above, please refer to the section on [creating a post](#creating-a-post).

The following files are only meant to be modified by the site maintainer in rare cases:
* [404](_pages/404.md)
* [category-archive](_pages/category-archive.md)
* [tag-archive](_pages/tag-archive.md)
* [year-archive](_pages/year-archive.md)

### Removing a page

To remove a page, delete the desired file in `_pages/` and delete the corresponding entry in [_data/navigation.yml](_data/navigation.yml).

## Creating a post

You may want to add new content: blog post, a new publication (abstract/more information), or a course description. These are all grouped under *posts* (in fact, anything that isn't a page is a post). This section will cover how to work with them.

### Publication

To add a *publication*, create a new file called `<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>-<shorthand>.md` in the [`_posts/papers` directory](_posts/papers). Note that `<shorthand>` will determine the URL of the file, so choose carefully.

Every file should start with the following:
```yaml
---
title: "My cool paper" # Add official title
author: <full name> # Add name to show profile in sidebar
categories: Publications # Used to list all posts about publications in /publications/
names: "Firstname lastname, Firstname lastname, ..." # names of all authors
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1234.5678 # link to paper
code: https://github.com/McGill-NLP/example  # link to code (optional)
webpage: https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/project  # link to project (optional)
video: https://youtube.com  # link to video (optional)
twitter: https://twitter.com/username  # link to twitter thread (optional)
demo: https://project-demo.com  # link to interactive demo (optional)
thumbnail: /assets/images/papers/figure.jpg  # link to a thumbnail (optional)
venue: ACL 2022  # venue and year of the paper
tags: ACL # tag of the paper (exclude year, use shorthand)
---
```

Then, it should be followed with the content in markdown:

```markdown

*{{ page.names }}*

**{{ page.venue }}**

{% include display-publication-links.html pub=page %}

## Abstract

In our cool paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art method to detect if an image is a hotdot or...
```

It will look like this in `/publications/`:

![Showing new post in the publication page](.github/images/demo-publication.jpg)


Notes:
* `author`: This links to one of the authors in `_data/authors.yml`. If the author is missing, this will not work.
* `{{ page.names }}` is a Jekyll snippet that will display the names of all authors (which was defined right above). This will save you from repeating yourself.
* `{{ page.venue }}` is a Jekyll snippet, just like `{{ page.names }}`.
* `include display-publication-links.html` will display the icons and links to code, webpage, tweets, etc. `pub=page` refers to the page object, which is handled by Jekyll.
* `thumbnail` links to a image located in `assets/images/papers`. If you don't have one, remove that line. You will need to upload the image to the repository before it shows up. Make sure you choose a picture:
  * in `jpg` (to save space), 
  * an aspect ratio of 4:3 (landscape), 
  * resolution of about 800x600, 
  * taken from your paper.

### Blog

To write a blog post, create a new file called `<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>-<shorthand>.md` in the [`_posts/blog` directory](_posts/blog). Note that `<shorthand>` will determine the URL of the file, so choose carefully.

Every file should start with the following:
```yaml
---
title: "My cool blog post" # Add title
author: <username> # Add your name (see above)
categories: # Used to list all blog posts in /blog/
  - Blog
tags: # Choose tag(s) not clashing with a conference name (optional)
  - Pytorch
excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->"  # Separate the excerpt from the body (optional)
last_modified_at: "2016-03-09" # Add modification date if relevant (optional)
---
```

Followed by the content in markdown:

```markdown
*Your summary here will be previewed on `/publications/`*

<!--more-->

Some starting statement

## Section in the paper

More content.
```

### Teaching
To write a course description, create a new file called `<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>-<shorthand>.md` in the [`_posts/teaching` directory](_posts/teaching). Note that `<shorthand>` will determine the URL of the file, so choose carefully.

```yaml
---
title: "COMP XYZ - Semester YYYY"  # Add course code, followed by the semester it's taught
author: Siva Reddy  # Name of the instructor
categories:
  - Teaching  # Used to list all posts describing a course in /teaching/
tags:
  - Winter 2022  # Semester
link: "https://docs.google.com/document/d/..." # Link to an external course description
---
```

Then, add content relevant to the course using markdown below the `---`, e.g.:

```markdown
*summary here*

## Syllabus

Content of syllabus here

```


### Deleting a post

You may want to delete posts forever. Then, delete the file in `_posts/`. If you simply want to hide it, you can prepend the file name with `hide`. For example, to hide the file `2016-03-09-COMP-XYZ.md`, you can rename it to `hide-2016-03-09-COMP-XYZ.md`.


## Create a profile page

> [!NOTE]
> *If you are having a hard time in this section, try to copy from someone else's profile and modify it.*

To have your own profile, you can create a new file called `<username>.md` in the [`_pages_/profiles` directory](_pages_/profiles). Note that `<username>` will determine the URL of the file, so choose carefully. You will need to add the following at the top:
```yaml
---
title: John Doe  # Add your name
permalink: /people/john/  # Add your username
layout: archive
classes:
    - wide
    - no-sidebar
---
```
Then, you can add any content you like using markdown:

```markdown
Welcome to John Doe's personal profile!

## Publications

<div>
  {% include posts-publication.html taxonomy="Publications" author="John Doe" %}
</div>

## Teaching

<div>
  {% include posts-category.html taxonomy="Teaching" author="John Doe" %}
</div>

## Blog posts

<div>
  {% include posts-category.html taxonomy="Blog" author="John Doe" %}
</div>

## Contact

Here's how to contact John Doe: ...
```

Note that by using `{% include posts-publication.html taxonomy="Publications" author="John Doe" %}`, you can display all posts about publications by filtering for "John Doe" in the `names` field of each publication. If you choose `{% include posts-category.html taxonomy="Teaching" author="John Doe" %}`, you can display all posts about teaching instead, and `taxonomy="Blog"` will display all posts about blog posts. Note that `posts-publication.html` and `posts-category.html` are special html files in `_includes/` that generate a list of post following a specific format. That's a Jekyll feature and is considered as an advanced feature, so you don't have to worry and can just directly use it like above.

Then, you can update `_data/authors.yml` to include a link to your profile page, e.g.:
```yaml
John Doe:
  name: "John Doe"
  # ...
  links:
    - label: "Page"
      url: "/people/siva"
      icon: "fas fa-fw fa-user"
    - label: "Github"
      url: "..."
    #...
```

## Resizing images

### Resizing bio images

To resize an image, you can use the following command:
```bash
python -m src.python.cli.optimize_images --source_dir assets/images/bio/
```

This will resize all images in `assets/images/bio/` to a resolution of 300x300 in webp format (they will be saved as '.avatar.webp').

### Resizing home images

To resize an image, you can use the following command:
```bash
python -m src.python.cli.optimize_homepage_images --source_dir assets/images/home/
```

## Advanced

> [!WARNING]
> *This section is meant for the maintainer(s) or developers of the site. Please consult the faculty members for more information on how to become a maintainer.*

### Setup

#### Codespace 

Most of the dependencies (`jekyll`, `ruby`, `gem`, Python `requirements.txt`, etc.) are already installed thanks to automations in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. You can simply open the repo in a codespace and start working.

#### Local
First, install jekyll. See [Jekyll installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) (e.g. [on Ubuntu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/)).

Then, you will need to install the python dependencies by running (from inside project directory):
```
pip3 install --user -r src/python/requirements.txt
```

You will need to install ruby and gem to use `jekyll` locally. This is only if you want to compile and run this site locally. If you want to modify a markdown file or a yaml file, you don't need to do that; please refer to the sections above for instructions. 

### Running the site in development mode

To run the site locally (or remotely on Codespaces), use the last command in the quickstart:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

We use the `minimal-mistakes` theme. Specifically, we use the `remote-theme` installation method, which is why the repo doesn't contain all of the html, css, and yaml files required for the theme. To learn more, read [this minimal-mistakes doc section](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#remote-theme-method). Note we are using a specific version of the theme, which can be found on `_config.yml`.


### Editing SCSS

If you need to modify some CSS attributes directly, you need to use [sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), or directly write CSS (which is still valid). You can create a new file in [_sass/custom](_sass/custom) and import it inside [_sass/main.scss](_sass/main.scss). Note that all files in [_sass/custom](_sass/custom) were added by the maintainers of this repo, in addition to the original styling provided by minimal-mistakes.

Here's a brief description:
* [_sass/custom/display-publications.scss](_sass/custom/display-publications.scss): Some custom CSS for styling the publications on `/publications/`, which did not have the same format in the original minimal-mistakes theme.
* [_sass/custom/no-sidebar.scss](_sass/custom/no-sidebar.scss): This adds an option to shift the page to the left side when there's no sidebar. Search for `no-sidebar` in [_config.yml](_config.yml) to see how to use it, or read [this post](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#layout-based-and-user-defined-classes).
* [_sass/custom/people-card.scss](_sass/custom/people-card.scss): This is a custom CSS for styling the "cards" for each member in `/people/`.
* [_sass/custom/skin.scss](_sass/custom/skin.scss): This is a custom CSS for styling the skin of the website.

### Custom `_includes/`

`_includes/` contains HTML and MD files that can be called from any page. It's something specific to Jekyll. To use it in your page, simply create an HTML file at  `_includes/my-file.html` and add the following to the front matter of your page:

```
{% include "my-file.html" %}
```

We have 5 custom `include` HTML files for this website. You may take a look at their usage by searching `include <name>.html` across the codebase.

### Custom `_layouts/`

You can create custom html layouts in `_layouts/`. For example, you can create a file called `my-layout.html`. It should contain a front matter block, followed by the HTML content:

```html
---
layout: archive
---

{{ content }}

<div>
  {% include ... %}
</div>
```

To use them, simply specify, in the front matters of a page in `_page/`:
```yaml
---
layout: publication
---
```

Example: In our case, we have a custom `publications.html` layout for the `/publications/` page.

#### Existing layouts

To better conceptualize this, here are the existing layouts in this repo:
* `_layouts/publication.html`: This is a custom layout for the `/publications/` page that displays all publications.
* `_layouts/profile.html`: TBD
* `_layouts/venue.html`: TBD

### Github Actions

We use Github Actions to automate processes. You can find the files in [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/), and see their status in the "Actions" tab. This requires you to use YAML.

### Python scripts

Some Python scripts are ran inside the actions. You can find them in [`src/python/`](src/python). If you want to run them locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r src/python/requirements.txt
python src/python/<script>.py
```

Replace `<script>` with the name of the script. If you want to add some library, you can add it to the requirements.txt file. Make sure to include the full version: `<library>==<version>`, or else it might break automation. For example, if you want to use the `requests` library, you can add it to the requirements.txt file as `requests==2.18.4`.

### Issue forms

To modify an issue form, simply edit the corresponding form in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). Note that if you make some major change, you might need to modify the python scripts. Thus, it is recommended to test that on a fork in order to avoid breaking the automation on the main repo.

### Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:

- [Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)
- [Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.

### Running tests

There are some tests for the python scripts. You can run them by running the following command in the root folder:
```bash
python -m unittest
```

## FAQ

> I created a post but it doesn't show up. What's wrong?

Make sure it is in the right directory, and that the file name is correct. The file name should be `<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>-<shorthand>.md`; this is not a convention or a preference, it is actually **needed** to render that file.

> I made a mistake when filling the form. How can I fix it?

After you fill the form, an issue is created with an appropriate *tag*. Then, a pull request (which is a "proposal" to make a change) is automatically created from that *tag*, based on the content of the issue. But if you made a mistake, then that PR is incorrect. So you should try to close it, or request the PR to be closed in a reply. Then, all you need to do is to modify the issue's content (makes sure the formatting stays the same, that's very important!). Once it's updated, you can remove the *tag*, refresh the page, then add back the same *tag*. This will create a new pull request, and a maintainer will review it.

> When using `src/python/add_publications_by_author.py`, it keeps adding a paper I already added (or I want to ignore). How can I make it stop doing that?

Add the semantic scholar paper ID to the list in `records/semantic_paper_ids_ignored.json`.


> When filling out the form, how do I upload my profile picture or a thumbnail without having to use an external source, like imgur?

1. Open a [new blank issue](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mcgill-nlp.github.io/issues/new). 
2. Click on "Attach files by dragging & dropping, selecting, or pasting them".
3. Upload your picture. 
4. Copy only the URL link (i.e. `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...png` only). Ignore the rest (i.e. `![text]()`).
5. Keep the link, but cancel the new issue. Paste that link in the form.

> The tests in `test_add_publications_by_author.py` are failing. What should I do?

Sometimes, semantic scholar will update the content of the paper. In that case, the failed tests have saved the new versions of those papers in `tests/scratch/_posts/papers`, and you will need to replace the old versions in `tests/data/add_publication_by_author/<author_name>` with the new versions in `tests/scratch/_posts/papers`. You can do that by running the following command:
```bash
python -m src.python.cli.replace_files_in_test_dir --source_dir tests/scratch/_posts/papers --target_dir tests/data/add_publications_by_author/siva
python -m src.python.cli.replace_files_in_test_dir --source_dir tests/scratch/_posts/papers --target_dir tests/data/add_publications_by_author/jackie
python -m src.python.cli.replace_files_in_test_dir --source_dir tests/scratch/_posts/papers --target_dir tests/data/add_publications_by_author/tim
```

> Does Semantic Scholar require an API key? I am getting an HTTP 429 error.

Although it is possible to make requests to Semantic Scholar without an API key, it is recommend to use one if available. Please set the environment variable `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` to your API key and it will be automatically used. For mcgill-nlp.github.io, we have set it up as a [*GitHub Repository Secret*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository); please look at `.github/workflows/auto-update-publications.yml` to see how the environment variable is assigned. You can update Github Repository secrets for Actions at [this settings page](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mcgill-nlp.github.io/settings/secrets/actions/).
