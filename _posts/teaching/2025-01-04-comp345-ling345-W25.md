# Description
Course Format: The course format is in person unless notified.

The last decades have seen phenomenal increases in our scientific and engineering understanding of language from a computational perspective. A large part of this success has been the rapid and unprecedented expansion of different kinds of language data as well as new computational tools for dealing with this data. This course provides an introduction to the data science of language. The emphasis will be on learning basic tools for working with language data for both engineering and scientific applications.

# Goals

The goal of this course is to learn how to think about language data (predominantly raw text) and to work with it computationally. Along the way, we will learn a number of mathematical and computational tools for data collection, representation, processing, modeling, and analysis. The main emphasis of the course will be on transferring theory into practice. By the end of the course, you will know how to visualize large amounts of text, study the nature of words, build thesauruses, search for information, and predict outcomes from social media text while also studying the ethical implications. An important side goals is to have fun with text!

# Students will

- Learn to visualize text.
- Learn how to analyze language data using simple statistical and machine learning methods.
- Learn how to build simple models of language domains.
- Learn how to predict outcomes based on text.
- Learn the biases of current NLP technology and their implications.
- Learn how to process different kinds of language data using Python.
- Learn how to query linguistic databases.

# Prerequisites

Required: Programming background at the level of COMP 202 or equivalent.

Recommended: Programming background at the level of COMP 250 or higher. Mathematics background at the level of MATH 240. Basic calculus and linear algebra will be helpful but not critical.

# Grading

There are six problem sets and no exam.

- Warm-Up Problem Sets 1 and 2 (20%): These will be a warm-up to get used to implementing Python and submitting (10% each).
- Problem Sets (80%): 4 problem sets equally weighted (20% each).

Because they are the primary method of assessment, **successful completion of each of problem sets 3-6 is required to pass the course**.  In other words, if you do not submit or receive an F on one of these problem sets, you may fail the course.

The details above are subject to change. If there are changes to the means of assessment after the add/drop date, you will have the option to decide whether the original or modified means of assessment will determine your final grade.

# Generative AI Policy

If you use any Generative AI tool for your submitted work (e.g., ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Claude), you must cite it and submit a detailed statement describing its use, as well as a log of the chat where you used it.

You may not use AI tools for:
* Copying AI-generated prose or non-trivial code chunks – this is plagiarism
* Writing whole assignments or code files
* Writing large chunks of an assignment or code
* Using AI without citing it in your assignment

Inappropriate use of Generative AI may result in penalties on grades or referral to disciplinary authorities. If you have any question about appropriate use of AI applications for course work, please contact the instructors in their office hours.
