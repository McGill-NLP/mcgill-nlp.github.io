# Description

The field of natural language processing (NLP) has seen multiple paradigm shifts over decades, from symbolic AI to statistical methods to deep learning. We review this shift through the lens of natural language understanding (NLU), a branch of NLP that deals with “meaning”. We start with what is meaning and what does it mean for a machine to understand language? We explore how to represent the meaning of words, phrases, sentences and discourse. We then dive into many useful NLU applications. 

Throughout the course, we take several concepts in NLU such as meaning or applications such as question answering, and study how the paradigm has shifted, what we gained with each paradigm shift, and what we lost? We will critically evaluate existing ideas and try to come up with new ideas that challenge existing limitations. We will particularly work on making deep learning models for language more robust.

This course will also delve into how large language models like ChatGPT are built, and latest advances on how to train/use these models for the task at hand.

# Prerequisites

You are expected to have done one of the following courses at McGill: natural language processing (COMP/LING 550) or computational linguistics (COMP/LING 445) or applied machine learning (COMP 551) or From Language to Data Science (COMP/LING 345). Make sure you are comfortable with advanced Python programming. If you have done similar courses at other universities, feel free to take the course. If you are not sure, email the instructor.

# Generative AI Policy

If you use any Generative AI tool for your submitted work (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude), you must **cite it** and submit a detailed statement describing its use as well as a log of the chat where you used it  .

You **may not** use AI tools for:  
- Copying AI-generated prose or non-trivial code chunks – this is plagiarism  
- Writing whole assignments or code files  
- Writing large chunks of an assignment or code  
- Using AI without citing it in your assignment  

Inappropriate use of Generative AI may result in penalties on grades or referral to disciplinary authorities. If you have any question about appropriate use of AI applications for course work, please contact the instructors in their office hours.
