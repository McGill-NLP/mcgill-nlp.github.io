# Overview

This is on Network Science, Graph Mining and Graph Learning. Networks model relationships in complex systems, from hyperlinks between webpages, and co-authorships between research scholars to biological interactions between proteins and genes, and synaptic links between neurons. Network Science is an interdisciplinary research area involving researchers from Physics, Computer Science, Sociology, Math and Statistics, with applications in a wide range of domains including Biology, Medicine, Political Science, Marketing, Ecology, Criminology, etc. In this course, we will cover the basic concepts and techniques used in Network Science, review the state of the art techniques, and discuss the most recent developments.

**Please note that about half of the class is paper discussions and student presentations.**
