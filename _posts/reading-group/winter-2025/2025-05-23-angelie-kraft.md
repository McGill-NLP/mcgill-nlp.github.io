The [NLP Reading Group]({% link _pages/reading-group.md %}) is thrilled to have [Angelie Kraft](https://angeliekraft.com/), a PhD at University of Hamburg, who will be discussing **Epistemic Injustice in the Age of Language Models**. The talk will happen on Zoom and in A14 on Friday May 23rd at 1PM.

## Talk Description

Language models are profoundly transforming our knowledge ecosystems. The more knowledge they produce or reproduce, the more influential they become. Yet, what do we mean by "more knowledge"? Whose knowledge are we considering? And whose standards are we using to measure our progress? Drawing from feminist epistemology, this talk will explore why it is crucial to question the "who" behind what we assume to be knowledge and the risks we might otherwise face. Moreover, the talk will provide insights into a recent analysis of social bias in popular question-answering benchmarks, highlighting concerns about the current state of language model evaluation.
