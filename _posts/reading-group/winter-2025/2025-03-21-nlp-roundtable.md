The [NLP Reading Group]({% link _pages/reading-group.md %}) is excited to have a roundtable discussion led by (Sara Vera Marjanovic)[https://spaidataiga.github.io/ ] who will be discussing the recent **investigations** of members of Prof. Siva Reddy's group on **the DeepSeek model**. In-person attendance is highly encouraged!

## Routable Description

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) mark a fundamental shift in LLM-based problem-solving by mimicking
human reasoning processes. In this paper, we analyze DeepSeek-R1, the first LRM for which we have access to
its reasoning chains. In our investigation of DeepSeek-R1, we focus on the content of these reasoning chains and
their patterns. We assess DeepSeek-R1’s capabilities in tasks that require deep reasoning — mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and world modeling. Further, we evaluate DeepSeek-R1’s performance in in-
context and long-context tasks, and examine the efficiency of its reasoning process. We explore parallels
between human and DeepSeek-R1’s reasoning. We then assess its safety, machine morality, and cultural
biases. Finally, we discuss the future of reasoning models and outline directions for further research in this
domain.

## Speaker Bio

Sara Vera Marjanovic is a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, currently visiting Mila as a research assistant with Siva Reddy and Karolina Stanczak. In Copenhagen, she is supervised by Isabelle Augenstein, Christina Lioma, and Maria Maistro in the NLP and IR research groups. Her previous research has looked at bias, interpretability, and uncertainty. However, during her time at Mila, she’s been working a lot more with reasoning chains and using this information to better interpret the output of Deepseek. Who knows what the future holds for her.
