The [NLP Reading Group]({% link _pages/reading-group.md %}) is excited to host [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/) who will be giving a talk **in-person** on "Language Learning through Social and Embodied Experience".

## Talk Description

Human language learning is shaped by social and embodied experience. Through interaction with others, we acquire the meanings and uses of language from communicative context. Language learning is also grounded to our sensorimotor experiences with the physical world, which connects words to actions and perceptions. In this talk, I will present several studies in my lab that explore social and embodied context for grounded language learning in computational models. I will describe acquisition of grounded verb semantics through a notion of physical causality. I will show how corrective feedback accelerates language learning. I will further highlight the role of grounding in fast mapping and discuss the emergence of symbol grounding in LLMs.
